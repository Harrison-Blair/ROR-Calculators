# ROR-Calculators
This repository holds a collection of calculators that are designed to improve the gameplay experience of Reform or Revolution (ROR).

These calculators are seemlessly combined into one, giving players of ROR an all in one application for Economy, Military, and Note management. While these features are intertwined and effect one another, they will be refered to as three seperate "modules" for ease of understanding, organization, and development. In whole, this application is designed to be an all-in-one tool for playing ROR in its current state. There are hopes that this calculator will one day become outdated with a graphical user interface, however for the sake of time a text based calculator is being created.
